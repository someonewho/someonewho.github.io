We get some data, and doing analysis for that.  
I feel too bad about our study, because we can do this better when we have more time.  
But we do our best for this.  
It is really hard to take the first step.  
I hope someone who have interest in this make better work based on our study.  
Now, we write academic paper and prepare ppt and script for final presentation.  
  
I'm really looking forward to going Korea back.  
I'm scared about korona virus, but also I'm really missing my home.
